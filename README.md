# Snewk
My first game in development created with python and pygame

# What the crap is Snewk?
Snewk is meant to be a Sokoban-styled game, in which you push animals, rocks and even instead of blocks to complete your objective! The game will have 8-bit graphics, chiptunes for the soundtrack and will feature stages inspired by the cities of Greece, Rome and Egypt.

# What are your inspirations?
Various Microsoft DOS games including King's Quest and Prince Of Persia.

# How do I access the secret levels?
...what secret levels...? **wink** **wink** **smirk** **snicker**
